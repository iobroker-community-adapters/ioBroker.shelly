The adapter communicates with Shelly devices by REST API and the CoAP or MQTT protocol.    

Uses the default Shelly firmware (no flashing of firmware needed!). You will find more and detailed information about the device here : [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud/)

If you use the CoAP protocol Shelly devices with Firmware 1.8.0 or above works only with the Shelly Adapter 4.0.0 or above. If you use devices with Firmware below 1.8.0 except of the Shelly 4Pro you have have to use Shelly Adapter 3.3.6 or below. The Shelly Adapter 4.0.0 or above would not work in this case! 

Attention, new firmware versions above 1.9.4 you have to enter a CoIoT server fot CoAP. You have to enter the IP address of your ioBroker server followed by the port 5683 on your Shelly device. For example, ioBroker runs on the IP address 192.168.1.2. Now you have to enter 192.168.1.2:5683 and activate CoIoT.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.
